# Welcome to the BoneHub-Datasets

This repository is a curated collection of publicly available datasets that include **3D bone models** or **3D medical imaging data** (such as CT and MRI scans) from which **3D bone models can be extracted**. It is designed as a centralized resource for researchers, engineers, and developers working in:

- Biomedical engineering  
- Medical image analysis  
- Biomechanics  
- Computer-aided diagnosis  
- 3D reconstruction and modeling  

We provide structured metadata, links, and usage details for each dataset in both human-readable and machine-readable formats. The aim is to simplify dataset discovery and comparison across anatomical regions and imaging modalities.

> 📌 *Note: This repository does not host any original dataset files — only information and links are provided.*
